### With this project, the author worked to create three aspects of content. 

- First, the authors shared some resources on how people have already researched school bullying. 
- Second, the author gave an idea of using AI to detect and prevent school bullying(Kennedy et al. 2019), as many studies have shown that bullying in school buses is subject to experience. 
- Third, the author described the future's work recommendation related to the study of school bullying. 

It was a challenge to stop school bullying entirely in any way. Still, in the end, the author believes it has successfully created tools and gathered resources to help people find out more about stopping or reducing bullying in schools. The author believes that teachers, administrators, parents, and students can benefit from the increased study of school bullying field.
